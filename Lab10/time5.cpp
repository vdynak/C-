//The minutesSinceMidnight calculates the time that has elapsed from midnight by multiplying the hours component of the Time object by 60 and adding it to the number of minutes of that object.
 // The minutesUntil function takes two parameters of class Time, earlier and later, which determines how far apart the times are from each other. The minutesSinceMidnight funcrion is used to determine how far each time is from midnight. If the earlier time happens to be later than the later time (as specified in the paramter) and either the hours and minutes, just hours, or just minutes are greater, then the difference is multiplied by -1. Otherwise the difference is returned.
 // The Time addMinutes function returns an object of class Time that provides an updated time of the original parameter Time time0 incremented by the second parameter value (the number of minutes). The function turns the original Time parameter in the form time0.h and time0.m to minutes. Then, it adds the incrementing minutes to this value. The new value is divided by 60 and assigned to time0.h and the new value undergoes the modulus operator to have an updated minute value assigned to time0.m. The updated time0 is returned.
 // The void printTimeSlot(TimeSlot ts), parameters: object ts of TimeSlot class, which includes movie and startTime (respective Movie and Time class), calculates endtime by calling the addMinutes function (parameters are filled with the members of the object of each class), function prints in the format "Back to the Future COMEDY (116 min) [starts at 9:15, ends by 11:11]"
 // The TimeSlot scheduleAfter function has parameters that are objects belonging to the TimeSlot and Movie class respectively. To create a new time for an expected return value of a TimeSlot object a new variable of class Time is created and assigned to the return of the function addMinutes accessing members of the oiginal actual parameters. Then, newTime is initialized with the actual paramter of nextMovie, followed by the new anticipated time.

 The function should return true if the two time slots overlap, otherwise return false. (Take into account the starting times of the time slots and the duration of the scheduled movies.)

 Hint: You may use minutesUntil to check which time slot is earlier, then find the how long is the interval between their starting times. They overlap if the movie duration is greater than the interval between the time slotsâ€™ starting times. Alternatively, converting times into minutes since midnight can be a good idea as well.
